# Serratia_Bacillus_Volatiles_Analysis
The common soil bacteria Serratia marcescens, Serratia proteamaculans, and Bacillus subtilis produce small molecular weight volatile compounds that are fungi-static against multiple species, including the zygomycete mold Rhizopus stolonifer (Mucoromycota). The compounds or the bacteria can be exploited in development of biological controls to prevent establishment of fungi on food and surfaces. Here, we quantified and identified  bacteria-produced volatiles using headspace sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that each bacterial species in culture has a unique volatile profile consisting of dozens of compounds. Using multivariate statistical approaches, we identified compounds in common or unique to each species. Our analysis suggested that three compounds, dimethyl trisulfide, anisole, and 2-undecanone, are characteristic of the volatiles emitted by these antagonistic bacteria.
